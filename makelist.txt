Create a high-quality, open-world action game inspired by Grand Theft Auto (GTA). The game should feature next-generation graphics, realistic physics, and immersive gameplay. Include:

A massive, detailed city with dynamic weather, day-night cycles, and lifelike NPC behavior.

A deep storyline with branching missions, heists, and player choices that affect outcomes.

Realistic vehicles, driving mechanics, and combat systems (both melee and ranged).

Highly detailed character models, reflections, lighting, and environmental effects.

Smooth animations and responsive controls for an ultra-immersive experience.
Make it feel like a “GTA-style game, but on a whole new level” — more realism, better graphics, and deeper interactivity.
